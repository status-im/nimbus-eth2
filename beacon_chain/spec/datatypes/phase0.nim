# it easy to keep up-to-date.

# These datatypes are used as specifications for serialization - thus should not
# be altered outside of what the spec says. Likewise, they should not be made
# `ref` - this can be achieved by wrapping them in higher-level
# types / composition

    ## When we receive blocks from outside sources, they are untrusted and go

    ## validations can be trusted to be well-formed, with a correct signature,
    ## having a parent and applying cleanly to the state that their parent
    ## left them with.
    ##
    ## When loading such blocks from the database, to rewind states for example,
    ## it is expensive to redo the validations (in particular, the signature
    ## checks), thus `TrustedBlock` uses a `TrustedSig` type to mark that these
    ## checks can be skipped.
    ##
    ## TODO this could probably be solved with some type trickery, but there
    ##      too many bugs in nim around generics handling, and we've used up
    ##      the trickery budget in the serialization library already. Until
    ##      then, the type must be manually kept compatible with its untrusted
    ##      cousin.
