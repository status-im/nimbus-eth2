# Batched gossip validation
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Batching in the context of BLS means collecting the signatures of several
# messages and verifying them all at once - this can be done more efficiently
# than verifying each message one by one, but the downside is that we get an
# all-or-nothing response - in case of an invalid signature, we must re-check
# each message separately.
#
# In addition to batching, we also perform lazy aggregation:
#
# * batching speeds up the verification of multiple signatures over different
#   messages, by a decent amount
# * lazy aggregation speeds up the verification of multiple signatures over the
#   same message, by a lot
#
# Due to the nature of gossip validation in eth2, it is common for messages
# to arrive in bursts - because most traffic on the network is valid (honest
# nodes don't re-broadcast invalid traffic and dishonest nodes quickly get
# disconnected), valid messages by far make up the bulk of traffic.
#
# Further, traffic is divided into topics - on a single topic it will be
# highly likely that the same message appears over and over again, but with
# different signatures, as most validators have the same view of the network -
# at least 2/3 or we're in deep trouble :)
