      ## Task to broadcast libp2p gossip. Started when a sync committee message
      ## is sent. Tracked separately from `handleValidatorDuties` to catch the
      ## case where `node.attachedValidators[].count == 0` at function start,
      ## and then a sync committee message gets sent from a remote VC via REST.
