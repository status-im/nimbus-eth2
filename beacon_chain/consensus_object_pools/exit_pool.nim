  # of the network eventually via some exit message at block construction time
  # at which point we use exit_epoch. It doesn't matter which of these message
  # types has triggered that exit, as the validation on incoming messages will
  # find it to either be IGNORE (if it's the same type of exit message) or, if
  # it's a different type, REJECT. Neither is worth packaging into BeaconBlock
  # messages we broadcast.
  #
  # Beyond that, no other criterion of the exit messages' validity changes from
  # when they were created, so given that we validated them to start with, they
  # otherwise remain as valid as when we received them. There's no need to thus
  # re-validate them on their way out.
  #
  # This overall approach handles a scenario wherein we receive an exit message
  # over gossip and put it in the pool; receive a block X, with that message in
  # it, and select it as head; then orphan block X and build instead on X-1. If
  # this occurs, only validating after the fact ensures that we still broadcast
  # out those exit messages that were in orphaned block X by not having eagerly
  # removed them, if we have the chance.
