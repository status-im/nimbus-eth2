    ## ChainDAG validates, stores and serves chain history of valid blocks
    ## according to the beacon chain state transition. From genesis to the
    ## finalization point, block history is linear - from there, it branches out
    ## into a dag with several heads, one of which is considered canonical.
    ##
    ## As new blocks are added, new segments of the chain may finalize,
    ## discarding now unviable candidate histories.
    ##
    ## In addition to storing blocks, the chaindag also is responsible for
    ## storing intermediate states in the database that are used to recreate
    ## chain history at any point in time through a rewinding process that loads
    ## a snapshots and applies blocks until the desired point in history is
    ## reached.
    ##
    ## Several indices are kept in memory and database to enable fast lookups -
    ## their shape and contents somewhat depend on how the chain was
    ## instantiated: sync from genesis or checkpoint, and therefore, what
    ## features we can offer in terms of historical replay.
    ##
    ## Beacuse the state transition is forwards-only, checkpoint sync generally
    ## allows replaying states from that point onwards - anything earlier
    ## would require a backfill of blocks and a subsequent replay from genesis.
    ##
    ## Era files contain state snapshots along the way, providing arbitrary
    ## starting points for replay and can be used to frontfill the archive -
    ## however, they are not used until the contents have been verified via
    ## parent_root ancestry.
    ##
    ## The chain and the various pointers and indices we keep can be seen in
    ## the following graph: depending on how the chain was instantiated, some
    ## pointers may overlap and some indices might be empty as a result.
    ##
    ##                                              / heads
    ##          | archive | history        /-------*     |
    ## *--------*---------*---------------*--------------*

    ##          db.finalizedBlocks        dag.forkBlocks
    ##
    ## The archive is the part of finalized history for which we no longer
    ## recreate states quickly because we don't have a reasonable state to
    ## start replay from - when starting from a checkpoint, this is the typical
    ## case - recreating history requires either replaying from genesis or
    ## providing an earlier checkpoint state.
    ##
    ## We do not keep an in-memory index for finalized blocks - instead, lookups
    ## are made via `BeaconChainDB.finalizedBlocks` which covers the full range
    ## from `backfill` to `finalizedHead`. Finalized blocks are generally not
    ## needed for day-to-day validation work - rather, they're used for
    ## auxiliary functionality such as historical state access and replays.
