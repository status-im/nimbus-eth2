    ## Pool of blocks responsible for keeping a DAG of resolved blocks.
    ##
    ## It is responsible for the following
    ##
    ## - Handle requests and updates to the "ColdDB" which
    ##   holds the canonical chain.
    ## - Maintain a direct acyclic graph (DAG) of
    ##   candidate chains from the last
    ##   finalized block.
    ##
    ## When a chain becomes finalized, it is saved in the ColdDB,
    ## the rejected candidates are discarded and this pool
    ## is pruned, only keeping the last finalized block.
    ##
    ## The last finalized block is called the tail block.
