installation package for the Nimbus beacon node.

To build the package, you'll need XCode and and the "Packages" tool freeware
developer tool from:
http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html

Make sure the `packagesbuild` binary is in your PATH and run `make nimbus-pkg`
from the root of this repo.
