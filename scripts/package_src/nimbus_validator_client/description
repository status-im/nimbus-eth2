Nimbus Validator Client for Ethereum
Nimbus is a client for the Ethereum network that is lightweight,
secure and easy to use.
.
Its efficiency and low resource consumption allows it to perform well
on all kinds of systems, ranging from Raspberry Pi's and mobile devices
where it contributes to low power consumption and security
-- to powerful servers where it leaves resources free to perform other tasks,
such as running an execution node.
.
The validator client allows advanced users to run validators in a separate
process from the beacon node, allowing more flexible deployment strategies.
