Nimbus Beacon Node / Ethereum Consensus client
Nimbus is a client for the Ethereum network that is lightweight,
secure and easy to use.
.
Its efficiency and low resource consumption allows it to perform well
on all kinds of systems, ranging from Raspberry Pi's and mobile devices
where it contributes to low power consumption and security
-- to powerful servers where it leaves resources free to perform other tasks,
such as running an execution node.
.
The beacon node connects to the beacon chain network, syncs historical data
and provides API's to monitor and interact with the beacon chain.
