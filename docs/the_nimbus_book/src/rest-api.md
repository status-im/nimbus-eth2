# REST API


The community has settled on REST as a common interface, as [documented here](https://ethereum.github.io/eth2.0-APIs/#/) -- the `REST` API is an updated version of the [`JSON-RPC` api](./api.md).

If you're looking to use this more standard API, you can enable it by running the Beacon Node with the `--rest` parameter (note this is currently in Beta).
