# REST API

Nimbus supports the [common REST API](https://ethereum.github.io/eth2.0-APIs/#/) for runtime communication with the application. For historical reasons, a [JSON-RPC-based API](./api.md) is also supported.

The REST API is currently in BETA -- to enable it, use the `--rest` option when starting the beacon node, then access the API from http://localhost:5052/.
