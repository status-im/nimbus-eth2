# Run a validator

Once your beacon node is [running and synced](./quick-start.md), the next step is to set up a validator.

## 1. Deposit

[Make a deposit](./deposit.md) for your validator

## 2. Import

[Import your validator keys](./keys.md) into Nimbus

## 3. Validate

[Start performing duties](./connect-eth2.md) by restarting the node

------------------------------------------------------

```admonish tip
While that's all there is to it, it is essential that you both [keep an eye on your validator](keep-an-eye.md) and [keep Nimbus updated](keep-updated.md) regularly ðŸ’«
