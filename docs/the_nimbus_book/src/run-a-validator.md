# Run a validator
Once your beacon node is [running and synced](./quick-start.md), the next step is to run a validator.

## 1. Deposit

[Make a deposit](./deposit.md) for your validator

## 2. Import 

[Import your validator keys](./keys.md) into Nimbus

## 3. Connect 

[Connect your validator](./connect-eth2.md) to eth2


</br>

------------------------------------------------------

</br>

While that's all there is to it, it is essential that you both [keep an eye on your validator](keep-an-eye.md) and [keep Nimbus updated](keep-updated.md) regularly 💫
