# Run a validator

Once your beacon node is [running and synced](./quick-start.md), the next step is to set up a validator.

!!! tip "No validator client needed"
    Unlike other beacon chain clients, Nimbus does not require setting up a separate validator client process - the beacon node can itself perform validator duties.

    This is a simple, safe and efficient way to get started.

    Advanced users may want to use a separate [validator client](./validator-client.md) process instead.

## Steps

### 1. Deposit

[Make a deposit](./deposit.md) for your validator

### 2. Import

[Import your validator keys](./keys.md) into Nimbus

### 3. Validate

[Start performing duties](./connect-eth2.md) by restarting the node

Congratulations - you're now set up to be earning a small amount of ETH every 6.4 minutes in return for keeping the Ethereum network secure!

!!! success "What next?"
    While that's all there is to it, it is essential that you both [keep an eye on your validator](keep-an-eye.md) and [keep Nimbus updated](keep-updated.md) regularly ðŸ’«
