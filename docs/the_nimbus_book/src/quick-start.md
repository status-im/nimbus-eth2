# Run the beacon node

This page takes you through how to run just the beacon node **without a validator attached.**

The beacon node connects to the network, syncs the chain and provides [API's](./rest-api.md) to monitor and interact with the beacon chain. To become a validator, you will need to run a beacon node.

Running a beacon node is a [worthwhile endeavor](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html#its-crucial-for-blockchain-decentralization-for-regular-users-to-be-able-to-run-a-node) even if your are not planning on validating yourself!
