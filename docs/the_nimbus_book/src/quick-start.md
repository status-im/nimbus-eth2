# Run the beacon node

This page takes you through how to run just the beacon node **without a validator attached.**

The beacon node connects to the eth2 network, manages the blockchain, and provides API's to interact with the beacon chain.

Running a beacon node without a validator attached is a [worthwhile endeavor](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html#its-crucial-for-blockchain-decentralization-for-regular-users-to-be-able-to-run-a-node).

It's also a necessary step to running a validator (since an active validator requires a synced beacon node).
