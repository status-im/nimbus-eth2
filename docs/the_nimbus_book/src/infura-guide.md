# Supplying your own Infura endpoint


In a nutshell, Infura is a hosted ethereum node cluster that lets you make requests to the eth1 blockchain without requiring you to set up your own eth1 node.

While we do support Infura to process incoming validator deposits, we recommend running your own eth1 node to avoid relying on a third-party-service.

> **Note:** Nimbus currently supports remote Infura nodes and [local Geth nodes](./eth1.md#geth). In the future, we plan on having our own eth1 client -- [Nimbus 1](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus) -- be the recommended default.

### 8. Run the beacon node

[Launch the beacon node](./start-syncing.md) on your favourite testnet, passing in your websocket endpoint as the [Web3 provider URL](./start-syncing.md#web3-provider-url).



### 9. Check stats

Visit your project's stats page to see a summary of your eth1 related activity and method calls
