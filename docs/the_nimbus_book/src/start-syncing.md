# Sync your node

Before you can use your node, it needs to sync with the network. Syncing starts automatically when you start your node, and may take several days depending on the performance of your hardware.

If you are planning to become a validator, you should ensure that your beacon node is [completely synced](./keep-an-eye.md#keep-track-of-your-syncing-progress) before submitting your deposit, or you might miss attestations and proposal duties until it has finished syncing.

!!! tip
    To get started more quickly, you can perform a [trusted node sync](./trusted-node-sync.md) instead - this requires access to a synced node or a third-party service.

!!! note
    You need need to run an execution client (**web3 provider**) together with the beacon node. See [here](./eth1.md) for instructions on how to do so.

## Networks

Using Nimbus, you can connect either to a testnet, or mainnet. Mainnet is the main ethereum network where real assets are at stake, while testnets are used by users and developers alike to test their node and setup before committing real assets.

!!! tip
    If this is the first time you're setting up your node, it is recommended you run it on a testnet first. Later, when everything is working, you can easily switch to mainned.

### Testnet

To start syncing the `prater` testnet , from the `nimbus-eth2` repository, run:

```
 ./run-prater-beacon-node.sh
```

### Mainnet


To start syncing the Ethereum beacon chain mainnet, run:

```
 ./run-mainnet-beacon-node.sh
```

## Data directory

While running, the beacon node will store chain data and other information its data directory, which by default is found in `build/data` - for more information, see the [data directory](./data-dir.md) guide.

## Command line options

You can add command line options to the startup command - for example, to change the port to 9100, use:

```sh
./run-prater-beacon-node.sh --tcp-port=9100 --udp-port=9100
```

To see a list of the command line options availabe to you, with descriptions, run:

```
./build/nimbus_beacon_node --help
```

More information is available from the [options](./options.md) page.

## Keep track of your sync progress

See [here](./keep-an-eye.md#keep-track-of-your-syncing-progress) for how to keep track of your sync progress.
