# Sync your node

Before you can use your node, it needs to sync with the network.
Syncing starts automatically when you start your node, and may take **several hours**, or even days, depending on the performance of your hardware.

!!! tip
    To get started more quickly, you can perform a [trusted node sync](./trusted-node-sync.md) instead.
    This requires access to a synced node or a third-party service.


If you are planning to become a validator, you should ensure that your beacon node is [completely synced](./keep-an-eye.md#keep-track-of-your-syncing-progress) before submitting your deposit; otherwise, you might miss attestations, proposal duties and sync committee duties until it has finished syncing.

!!! note
    You need need to run an execution client (**web3 provider**) together with the beacon node.
    See [here](./eth1.md) for instructions on how to do so.

## Networks

Using Nimbus, you can connect either to a testnet or mainnet.
Mainnet is the main Ethereum network where real assets are at stake, while testnets are used by users and developers alike to test their node and setup before committing real assets.

If this is the first time you're setting up your node, it is recommended you run it on a testnet first.
Later, when everything is working, you can easily switch to mainnet.

=== "Testnet"

    To start syncing the `holesky` testnet from the `nimbus-eth2` repository, run:

    ```
     ./run-holesky-beacon-node.sh
    ```

=== "Mainnet"

    To start syncing the Ethereum beacon chain mainnet, run:

    ```
     ./run-mainnet-beacon-node.sh
    ```

## Log output

You should see the following output:

## Data directory

While running, the beacon node will store chain data and other information its data directory, which by default is found in `build/data`.
For more information, see the [data directory guide](./data-dir.md).

## Command line options

You can add command line options to the startup command.
For example, to change the port to 9100, use:

```sh
./run-holesky-beacon-node.sh --tcp-port=9100 --udp-port=9100
```

To see a list of the command line options available to you, with descriptions, run:

```
./build/nimbus_beacon_node --help
```

More information is available from the [options](./options.md) page.

## Keep track of your sync progress

See [here](./keep-an-eye.md#keep-track-of-your-syncing-progress) for how to keep track of your sync progress.

## Checkpoint sync

!!! note ""
    This feature is available from `v23.11.0` onwards.

You can use an existing synced node or a third-party service to accelerate sync significantly. Instead of downloading and verifying the entire blockchain, you can point Nimbus to a trusted block.

!!! warning
    Selecting a block from an untrusted source or using an outdated block or state may lead to Nimbus syncing to an unexpected state. Especially when [running a validator](./run-a-validator.md), it is vital to pick a recent trusted block for checkpoint sync, and to verify that Nimbus is synced to the correct state before starting validator duties.

!!! note
    The Nimbus database must be empty to use checkpoint sync. When using a pre-existing database, checkpoint sync options are ignored.

!!! tip
    A list of community-operated checkpoint sync nodes can be found [here](https://eth-clients.github.io/checkpoint-sync-endpoints/).

To use checkpoint sync, run the following commands (inserting the checkpoint sync endpoint and your own trusted block root):

=== "Holesky"
    ```sh
    CHECKPOINT_SYNC_ENDPOINT=http://127.0.0.1:8551
    TRUSTED_BLOCK_ROOT=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234
    ./run-holesky-beacon-node.sh \
        --external-beacon-api-url=$CHECKPOINT_SYNC_ENDPOINT \
        --trusted-block-root=$TRUSTED_BLOCK_ROOT
    ```

=== "Mainnet"
    ```sh
    TRUSTED_BLOCK_ROOT=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234
    ./run-mainnet-beacon-node.sh \
        --external-beacon-api-url=$CHECKPOINT_SYNC_ENDPOINT \
        --trusted-block-root=$TRUSTED_BLOCK_ROOT
    ```

The following [configuration options](./options.md) control checkpoint sync behaviour:

| Option                                   | Description |
|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| <nobr>`--external-beacon-api-url`</nobr> | <ul><li>External beacon API to use for checkpoint sync</li></ul> |
| <nobr>`--trusted-block-root`</nobr>      | <ul><li>Recent trusted finalized block root to sync from external beacon API</li><li>Uses the [light client sync protocol](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/v1.4.0-beta.3/specs/altair/light-client/sync-protocol.md) to obtain the latest finalized checkpoint</li></ul> |
| <nobr>`--trusted-state-root`</nobr>      | <ul><li>Recent trusted finalized state root to sync from external beacon API</li><li>Takes precedence over `--trusted-block-root` if both are specified</li></ul> |

!!! info
    If the external beacon API does not support serving [light client data](./light-client-data.md), use the `--trusted-state-root` option instead of `--trusted-block-root`.
