# Email notifications

You can create an account on [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in/) to set up email notifications in case your validator loses balance (goes offline), or gets slashed.

!!! tip
    If your validator loses balance for two epochs in a row, you may want to investigate.
    It's a strong signal that it may be offline.

### 1. Sign up at [beaconcha.in/register](https://beaconcha.in/register)

### 2. Type your validator's public key into the search bar
