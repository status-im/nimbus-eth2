# Add an additional validator

To add an additional validator, [generate a new key](./more-keys.md) then follow [the same steps](./keys.md) as you did when adding your other keys.

You'll have to [restart](./connect-eth2.md) the beacon node for the changes to take effect.

```admonish tip
A single Nimbus instance is able to handle multiple validators.
```
