# Add an additional validator

# TODO: We should work on a new recommended way to add validators based on the Keymanager API (this doesn't require a node restart)

To add an additional validator, [generate a new key](./more-keys.md) then follow [the same steps](./keys.md) as you did when adding your other keys.

You'll have to [restart](./connect-eth2.md) the beacon node for the changes to take effect.

!!! tip
    A single Nimbus instance is able to handle multiple validators.
