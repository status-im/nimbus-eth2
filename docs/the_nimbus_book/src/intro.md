# The nim-beacon-chain Book

_Documentation for Nimbus Beacon Chain users and developers._

Nimbus beacon chain is a research implementation of the beacon chain component of the upcoming Ethereum Serenity upgrade, aka Eth2.

- Open sourced at [github.com/status-im/nim-beacon-chain](https://github.com/status-im/nim-beacon-chain/tree/master).
- Specification of our implementation can be found at [ethereum/eth2.0-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/tree/v0.12.1#phase-0).

## Overview

In this book, we will cover:

1. [What is beacon chain](./faq.md#1-what-is-beacon-chain) and [what is Nimbus](./faq.md#4-what-is-nimbus) to equip you with some basic knowledge.
2. [Installation steps](./install.md) outline the prerequisites to get started.
3. [Running the beacon node](./beacon_node.md) describes how to run the beacon node software to sync the beacon chain.
4. How to [become a validator](./validator.md) in Ethereum 2.0 as a user, for example on the Altona testnet.
5. [API](./api.md) for monitoring your node through `http`.
6. [Advanced usage](./advanced.md) for developers.
7. Common [questions and answers](./faq.md) to satisfy your curiosity.
8. How to [contribute](./contribute.md) to this book.

Feel free to give us feedback on how to improve as well as contribute to our book on github. :)
