# Make a deposit for your validator

To make a deposit, you will need to generate keys then submit a deposit transaction to the execution chain.

!!! tip
    The process of setting up a validator is also documented at the Ethereum launchpad site:

    * [Mainnet](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/)
    * [Prater](https://prater.launchpad.ethereum.org/)

!!! tip
    Use Prater to stress test / future proof  your set up against peak mainnet load. See [here](./prater.md) for all you need to know

## Download the deposit tool

Start by downloading and unpacking the [deposit tool](https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/releases/latest) provided by the Ethereum Foundation:

```sh
# Enter the nimbus folder
cd nimbus-eth2

# Make sure to get the latest version from the download page
wget https://github.com/ethereum/staking-deposit-cli/releases/download/v2.2.0/staking_deposit-cli-9ab0b05-linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Unpack the archive
tar xvf staking_deposit-cli-9ab0b05-linux-amd64.tar.gz --strip-components 2
```

## Generate keys

!!! tip
    You can increase the security of this process by downloading a [Live linux image](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/try-ubuntu-before-you-install). To do so, copy `deposit` to a USB stick, boot into the live image, and run the tool from inside the image. Make sure you **don't** enable Wifi and unplug any Ethernet cables when using this process.

The deposit tool generates a seed phrase, and uses this to create validator and withdrawal keys.

!!! danger
    If you lose you seed phrase and your withdrawal key, your funds will be lost forever!

=== "Mainnet"
    ```sh
    # Run the deposit tool and follow the instructions on screen
    ./deposit new-mnemonic --chain mainnet
    ```

=== "Prater"
    ```sh
    # Run the deposit tool and follow the instructions on screen
    ./deposit new-mnemonic --chain prater
    ```

## Make the deposit

Once created, the keys are used to create a deposit transaction on the Ethereum execution chain. Follow the instructions at https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/upload-deposit-data to upload the deposit data.

!!! warning
    If you are making a mainnet deposit make sure you verify that the deposit contract you are interacting with is the correct one.

    You should verify that the address is indeed: [0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa)

!!! info
    Once you send off your transaction(s), your validator will be put in a queue based on deposit time. Getting through the queue may take a few hours or days (assuming the chain is finalising). No validators are accepted into the validator set while the chain isn't finalising. The `Pending Validators` metric on the [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in/) will give you the size of the queue.

With the keys created, you're ready to perform the [key import](./keys.md).
