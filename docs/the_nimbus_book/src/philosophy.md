# Design goals

One of our most important design goals is an application architecture that makes it **simple to embed Nimbus into other software.**

Another goal is to **minimize reliance on third-party software.**

A third one is for the application binary to be as **lightweight as possible in terms of resources used.**

### Integration with Status

As part of our first design goal, our primary objective here is for Nimbus to be tightly integrated into the [Status messaging app](https://status.im/).

Our dream is for you to be able to run and monitor your validator straight from Status desktop.
