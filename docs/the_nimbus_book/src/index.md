# The Nimbus Guide

!!! note ""
    If you're eager to get started, check out our [quickstart guide](./quick-start.md). Coming from a different client? Check out the [migration guide](./migration.md).

Nimbus is a client for the Ethereum `consensus layer` (eth2) and `execution layer` (eth1) that is [lightweight](https://our.status.im/ethereum-is-green/), [secure](./audit.md) and [easy to use](./run-a-validator.md).

This book describes the consensus layer client, `nimbus-eth2`, in particular.

Its efficiency and low resource consumption allows it to perform well on all kinds of systems, ranging from Raspberry Pi's and mobile devices where it contributes to low power consumption and security -- to powerful servers where it leaves resources free to perform other tasks, such as running an [execution node](./eth1.md).

This book explains the ways in which you can use Nimbus to either monitor the beacon chain or become a fully-fledged validator.

!!! note
    Staking and becoming a validator on Ethereum requires 32 ETH, a stable high-speed internet connection and an always-on server. Before staking, make sure that you understand the requirements and practice setting up a validator on a testnet. [Pooled staking](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/pools/) and [Staking as a service](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/saas/) are alternative ways to stake in the network. You can also run a Nimbus node without staking.
