# System requirements (recommended)


-----------------
**Operating System:** Linux [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing), Windows 64-bit, macOS X 10.14+,

**Memory:** 4GB RAM

**Storage:** 200GB SSD

In order to process incoming validator deposits from the eth1 chain, you will need to run an eth1 client in parallel to your eth2 client. While it is possible to use a third-party service like [Infura](/infura-guide.md), if you choose to run your own eth1 client locally, you'll need more memory and storage.

For example, you'll need at least another **500GB SSD** to run [geth fast sync](/eth1.md) on mainnet.

To future proof your setup we recommend a **1TB SSD**.
