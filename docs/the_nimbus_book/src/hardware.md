# System requirements (recommended)

The recommended system requirements for running the Nimbus beacon node are:

-----------------
**Operating System:** Linux [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing), Windows 64-bit, macOS X 10.14+,

**Memory:** 2GB RAM

**Storage:** 200GB SSD

**Internet:** Reliable broadband connection

----------------

In addtion to the beacon node, you will need to run an [execution client](./eth1.md) - check the documentation of the client of choice and add them to the above requirements.

Broadly, to run both an execution and a consensus client on the same machine, we recommend a **2 TB** SSD drive and **8** GB RAM.

----------------

Nimbus has been optimized to also run well on hardware significantly less powerful than the recommended system requirements - the more validators you run on the same node, the more hardware resources and network bandwidth will it will use.
