# System requirements (recommended)

**Operating System:** Linux [64-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing), Windows 64-bit, macOS X 10.14+,

**Memory:** 4GB RAM

**Storage:** 160GB SSD

**Internet:** Reliable broadband connection

Note that in order to process incoming validator deposits from the eth1 chain, you will need to run an eth1 client in parallel to your eth2 client. While it is possible to use a third-party service like [Infura](/infura-guide.md), if you choose to run your own eth1 client locally, you'll need more memory and storage.

For example, you'll need at least another **290GB SSD** to run [geth fast sync](/eth1.md) on mainnet.
