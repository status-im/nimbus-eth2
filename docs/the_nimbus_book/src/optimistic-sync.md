# Optimistic sync

Optimistic sync is the process of syncing an execution and consensus client concurrently, without having the consensus client wait for the execution client.
During optimistic sync, the consensus client quickly syncs up to the latest consensus but delays verifying block execution payloads: it continuously informs the execution client of the latest consensus head, allowing the execution client to perform a snapshot sync directly to the latest state.

Once the execution client has caught up, the consensus and execution clients work in lock-step each validating the block.

Both execution and consensus clients must be fully synced to perform validation duties: while optimistically synced, validator duties (attestation, sync committee and block production work) are skipped.

!!! info "Running without execution client"
    Nimbus continues to sync optimistically when the execution client is not available thanks to its built-in execution payload verifier.

    This feature is available from `v23.1.0` onwards.
    A preview of the feature could be enabled with `--optimistic` in earlier versions - this flag is no longer needed.

## Identifying optimistic sync

An optimistically synced node can be identified by examining the "Slot start" log message.
When optimistically synced, the `sync` key will have a `/opt` suffix, indicating that it's waiting for the execution client to catch up:
