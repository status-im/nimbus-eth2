# Keep Nimbus updated

Make sure you stay on the lookout for any critical updates to Nimbus. This best way to do so is through the **announcements** channel on our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/XRxWahP).

To update to the latest version, run:

```
git pull && make update
```

Then [rebuild the beacon node.](./build.md)

> **Note:** If your beacon node is already running, you'll need to disconnect and reconnect for the changes to take effect.
