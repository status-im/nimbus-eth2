# Keep your validator updated

Make sure you stay on the lookout for any critical updates to Nimbus. This best way to do so is through the **announcements** channel on our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/XRxWahP).

To update to the latest version, disconnect from medalla and run:

```
git pull && make update
```

Once the update is complete, run `make medalla` to reconnect to the network.
