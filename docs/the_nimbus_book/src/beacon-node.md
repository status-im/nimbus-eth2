# Run just the beacon node

The beacon node application connects to the eth2 network, manages the blockchain, and provides API's to interact with the beacon chain.

You can **run the beacon node without being a validator** - doing so allows you to sync the network and access its latest state.

## Prerequisites

Before building and running the application, make sure you've gone through the [installation guidelines](./install.md).

## Building the node

To build the beacon run:

#### 1. Clone the nim beacon chain repository

```
git clone https://github.com/status-im/nimbus-eth2
cd nimbus-eth2
```

#### 2. Run the beacon node build process

```
make nimbus_beacon_node
```

## Running the node

When running the beacon node, you connect to a specific ethereum 2 network - this may be a private network or a public testnet like [Medalla](https://github.com/goerli/medalla/).

> **Note:** when running the node for the first time, you may need to specify network parameters, boot nodes and genesis information. This information can typically be found in the [eth2 testnets](https://github.com/eth2-clients/eth2-testnets) repository.

Once the beacon node is running, it will first connect to the boot nodes in the network, look for more peers and start syncing the chain. Once the sync is complete, it will keep following the head of the chain (you can interact with it through the [API](./api.md).

Before running the beacon node, it's important that your computer is set to the correct time - preferably using a trusted time source (this can be an NTP server you trust, GPS time or another precise source of time) -- however don't worry if you're unsure of how to do this, it isn't essential for testnet purposes.

### Syncing

To start syncing the `medalla` network:


```
make medalla

# Build output...

```

This will build Nimbus and its dependencies, and connect you to Medalla.
You should see that the beacon node has launched and started syncing.

```

### Status bar

The status bar shows important health information about your node:

* peers - The number of peers you're connected to
* finalized - The block root and epoch of the latest finalized checkpoint - when the network is healthy, this value will stay at 2-3 epochs from the wall clock
* head - The block root and time of the head block - as blocks are produced and processed, this will be updated to the latest head block as chosen by the consensus algorithm.
* time - The current wall time according to your computer - when the node is synced, the head block will closely follow this time.
* ETH: the total ETH validators attached to the node have accumulated. When there are no validators attached, this number will be 0.

Time is shown as `epoch:subslot`, starting from the block chain genesis time - one epoch is typically 32 slots but this may vary between networks.

The status bar content may be updated using command line flags.

### Metrics
Nimbus includes metrics support using the Prometheus format. To enable it, you need to enable the insecure feature when compiling the application. The http server that exports Prometheus metrics should not be exposed to external parties.

```
# Compile with insecure features enabled
make NIMFLAGS="-d:insecure" medalla
```

## Help
To see a list of command line options with descriptions, navigate to the `build` directory and run:
