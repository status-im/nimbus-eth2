# Command line

Command line options allow you to customize the way your beacon node operates.

You pass options to the beacon node by adding them to the command line.
For example, if you want to launch Nimbus on mainnet with different base ports than the default `9000/udp` and `9000/tcp`, say `9100/udp` and `9100/tcp`, run:

```sh
./run-mainnet-beacon-node.sh --tcp-port=9100 --udp-port=9100
```

## Available options

To see the full list of command line options available to you, with descriptions, run:

```sh
build/nimbus_beacon_node --help
```

You should see the following output:

Any `debug`-prefixed flags are considered ephemeral and subject to removal without notice.

## Configuration files

All command line options can also be provided in a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/)
config file specified through the `--config-file` flag.
Within the config file, you need to use the long names of all options.
Please note that certain options
such as `web3-url`, `bootstrap-node`, `direct-peer`, and `validator-monitor-pubkey`
can be supplied more than once on the command line: in the TOML file, you need
to supply them as arrays.

There are also some minor differences in the parsing
of certain option values in the TOML files in order to conform more closely to
existing TOML standards.
For example, you can freely use keywords such as `on`,
`off`, `yes` and `no` on the command-line as synonyms for the canonical values
`true` and `false` which are mandatory to use in TOML. Options affecting Nimbus
sub-commands should appear in a section of the file matching the sub-command name.

Here is an example config file illustrating all of the above:

!!! example "nimbus-eth2.toml"
    ```toml
    # Comments look like this
    doppelganger-detection = true
    web3-url = ["http://127.0.0.1:8551"]
    num-threads = 0

    [trustedNodeSync]
    trusted-node-url = "http://192.168.1.20:5052"
    ```
