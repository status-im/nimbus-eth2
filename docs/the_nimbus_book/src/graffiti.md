# Graffiti

You can use your validator client's graffiti flag to add a personal touch to your proposed blocks (some text of your choice). You will be able to see it using the block explorer.

To do so on **Pyrmont**, run:

```
./run-pyrmont-beacon-node.sh --graffiti="<YOUR_GRAFFITI>"
```

To do so on **Mainnet**, run:

```
./run-mainnet-beacon-node.sh --graffiti="<YOUR_GRAFFITI>"
```
