The Nimbus Guide is written using markdown and [material for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

See the `Makefile` for setup.

The guide is divided into several sections - broadly:

* Guides - walk-throughs that allow the user to get started with a specific area of the client
* How-to:s - short pages that show the user how to solve a specific problem or perform a specific task
* Reference - pages describing how specific parts of Nimbus work, reference-style
* "Other" - explanations of concepts, background etc.

## Resources
