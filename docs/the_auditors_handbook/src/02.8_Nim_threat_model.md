# Nim threat model

!!! warning
    This auditors' handbook is frozen and obsolete; the [Nim language manual](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html) alongside [other Nim documentation](https://nim-lang.org/documentation.html), [Status Nim style guide](https://status-im.github.io/nim-style-guide/), [Chronos guides](https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos/blob/master/docs/src/SUMMARY.md), and [Nim by Example](https://nim-by-example.github.io/getting_started/) supercede it.

Nim and its standard library are not the focus of the audits.

In particular the codebase intentionally limits reliance on the standard library
so that it is not tied to Nim release schedule, instead of the standard library
we use `stew` most of the time: [https://github.com/status-im/nim-stew](https://github.com/status-im/nim-stew).

Nim standard library is implemented here:
- [https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/tree/v1.2.4/lib](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/tree/v1.2.4/lib)

We target Nim v1.2.2
