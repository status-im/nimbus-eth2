## Arrays

## Openarrays

Openarray are a parameter-only type that represent a (pointer, length) pair.
In other languages they are also known as slices, ranges, views, spans.

_The name openArray is inherited from Pascal, Oberon and Modula 2_

Arrays and sequences are implictily converted to openArray.

The compiler has a limited form of escape analysis to prevent capturing openarrays in closures
or returning them.
